# Rotten-Tomatoes-Analysis-R

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between movie MPAA ratings (G, PG, R, etc.) and their critical reception ("Rotten" vs. "Certified Fresh"). Using the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, I performed data wrangling and visualization to identify trends in studio output and director performance.

## Key Technical Skills
* **Language:** R (Base R)
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, fixing typographical errors in raw data strings.
* **String Manipulation:** Using Regular Expressions (`grep`) to filter complex genre tags.
* **Visualization:** Creating Mosaic Plots to visualize categorical variable correlations.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Generating contingency tables for multi-variable analysis.

## Analysis Highlights
* **Data Cleaning:** Standardized inconsistent rating labels (e.g., correcting "PG-13)" to "PG-13").
* **Genre Filtering:** Implemented pattern matching to distinguish between primary genres (e.g., "Comedy") vs. sub-genres.
* **Visual Insights:** Produced mosaic plots to reveal the density of "Certified Fresh" movies across different age ratings.

## How to View
This is a Jupyter Notebook running an R kernel. GitHub renders the notebook automatically, showing both the code and the resulting plots/tables.
